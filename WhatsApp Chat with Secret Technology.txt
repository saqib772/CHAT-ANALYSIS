05/07/2023, 7:28 pm - Saqib: About genes one
05/07/2023, 7:29 pm - You added Chirag Gaba🖤~
05/07/2023, 7:30 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Let's stick to what we know
05/07/2023, 7:30 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: 😅😅
05/07/2023, 7:31 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Technology and design
05/07/2023, 7:32 pm - Saqib: Bruuh
05/07/2023, 7:33 pm - Saqib: We are talking about our own technology
05/07/2023, 7:34 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Great One..!🤷🏽‍♂️
05/07/2023, 7:34 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Point point
05/07/2023, 7:34 pm - You changed the group description
05/07/2023, 7:36 pm - Saqib: Ok I'm going to Gym will work on this
05/07/2023, 7:37 pm - moveupp: There is another idea i wanted to design a machine which is like a human ,... But intelligent enough to do any task and find,solutions for problems
05/07/2023, 7:37 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Human Mind can Think Beyond the Limits so we will Make that Kind of Technologies..!🤣🤷🏽‍♂️
05/07/2023, 7:37 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Where have I heard this?
05/07/2023, 7:37 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Common ,,. 🫣
05/07/2023, 7:41 pm - moveupp: Yup ... I mean that's was the ultimate purpose of Ai
05/07/2023, 7:45 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: So you want a robot inbuilt with gpt? <This message was edited>
05/07/2023, 7:46 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: That is doable right?
05/07/2023, 7:49 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Yes...Mostly🤷🏽‍♂️
05/07/2023, 7:50 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: 💯
05/07/2023, 8:12 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Well from an automotive perspective, I was thinking of focus driven engine system. I feel this would prevent alot of sleep deprivation accident.  This can be done by measuring to alpha, beta and the theta waves using EEG and syncing it to the electronic control module in the vehicle
05/07/2023, 8:12 pm - moveupp: Hmmm .... Its a great idea ....
05/07/2023, 8:13 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Bro, Great Idea...
♥️
05/07/2023, 8:14 pm - moveupp: Le @919646357562  be like now some realistic idea came, xD
05/07/2023, 8:15 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Lol
05/07/2023, 8:21 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Well we could try uploaded intelligence
05/07/2023, 8:22 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: But I feel we don't have the technology yet
05/07/2023, 8:22 pm - moveupp: Same
05/07/2023, 8:23 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Coding consciousness is tough, but it can be done once we start figuring out a way to download the......... Aaaaaah
05/07/2023, 8:23 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Got an idea
05/07/2023, 8:25 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Recently, MIT not sure if I'm right, were able to record dreams and memories by converting brainwaves to data and feeding it to Stable diffusion model. <This message was edited>
05/07/2023, 8:26 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: They were able to download and record memories and dreams. What if the memories and dreams are training data to a new model that is not touched. They can be taught and act like the person from the memories eventually being the person himself after some time
05/07/2023, 8:27 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Then reveal to that new model that it is him and he died and you uploaded the memories into him
05/07/2023, 8:28 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Where are we lacking?
05/07/2023, 8:30 pm - moveupp: ... How we are going to record dream and memories ....🤔
05/07/2023, 8:31 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/21651818/scary-ai-image-scientists-read-your-mind/
05/07/2023, 8:31 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Cornell University not MIT
05/07/2023, 8:31 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: My bad
05/07/2023, 8:32 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/breakthrough-could-enable-others-to-watch-your-dreams-and-memories-video/
05/07/2023, 8:33 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Alot are sprouting up right now
05/07/2023, 8:43 pm - moveupp: i see .. for scaning we need fMRI ...
05/07/2023, 8:44 pm - moveupp: Will it be helpful if we somehow found a connection from Cornell University which might help us contacting with those who worked on this thing ? what you say @971524676327 ?
05/07/2023, 8:52 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: 💯💯
05/07/2023, 8:53 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: 🫣....Brp You Live in 2040
05/07/2023, 8:53 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: 🫠
05/07/2023, 8:53 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Before we get into that, though I am not a pro in this field, I do have a vision for this stuff. So from my point of view I feel we can do it. But from an AI expert do you know if it's feasible or a dead end?
05/07/2023, 8:54 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: How developed is our current AI capability
05/07/2023, 8:54 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Seems to any Hardware, Device that Reads the Neurons waves and Much other things of mind..!
05/07/2023, 8:55 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Thanks a lot dude😅
05/07/2023, 8:55 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Bro , 💯💯
05/07/2023, 8:57 pm - moveupp: i think we can
05/07/2023, 8:57 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Then, let's go for it
05/07/2023, 8:57 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: But how..?
05/07/2023, 8:58 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: We need to figure out how LLM work
05/07/2023, 8:58 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: And what architecture they follow
05/07/2023, 8:58 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Right now
05/07/2023, 9:00 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: I am right now at the ML stage. Need to delve into DL and then LLM
05/07/2023, 9:00 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: So not sure how the model works now
05/07/2023, 9:00 pm - Saqib: Can you elaborate more on this?
05/07/2023, 9:03 pm - Saqib: Bro You know the case that a Dead Women Came to her own funeral
05/07/2023, 9:03 pm - Saqib: Hologram and other technology
05/07/2023, 9:03 pm - Saqib: + AI used in that
05/07/2023, 9:04 pm - Saqib: I also tried to but I couldn't find the Data of my loved one.
05/07/2023, 9:04 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Sure, so if you do a bit if research you will know that when we sleep or day dream our brain waves will be comparatively low but especially the theta waves will be high will be but a bit active to make sure we wake up in case of emergency so it will be alert. But when we are awake it will be at a different range. So if we program the limit or create an algorithm that can calibirate to our brain waves and sync it to the ECM we can make our car stop or alter ourself in times of crisis
05/07/2023, 9:05 pm - Saqib: Else the codes are available for this on Internet
05/07/2023, 9:05 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: I don't think so, you will have to contact the research author to get them
05/07/2023, 9:05 pm - Saqib: Yes It's free
05/07/2023, 9:06 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: For the hologram, we can use refractive hologran
05/07/2023, 9:06 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Oh
05/07/2023, 9:06 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Yes
05/07/2023, 9:06 pm - Saqib: MRI Machines and Algos with prediction systems
05/07/2023, 9:06 pm - Saqib: What's That?
05/07/2023, 9:07 pm - Saqib: So I don't work on that project
05/07/2023, 9:07 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: You know the ones that look like a pyramid
05/07/2023, 9:07 pm - Saqib: ?
05/07/2023, 9:09 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: <Media omitted>
05/07/2023, 9:09 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Oh
05/07/2023, 9:09 pm - Saqib: Oh Wow 😦😳
05/07/2023, 9:09 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: How do the data look like?
05/07/2023, 9:09 pm - Saqib: Never heard this before
05/07/2023, 9:10 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: I actually built one for my UG 1st year science exhibition
05/07/2023, 9:10 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Lost it now😂
05/07/2023, 9:10 pm - Saqib: It's about the Voice chats of loved ones, Text messages. 
Voice chat is Compulsory so you get the same feeling when talking to her
05/07/2023, 9:10 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Instead of mobile you can use projector also
05/07/2023, 9:10 pm - Saqib: Them*
05/07/2023, 9:11 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Aah ok ok
05/07/2023, 9:11 pm - Saqib: No way You store the code of it
05/07/2023, 9:11 pm - Saqib: <Media omitted>
05/07/2023, 9:12 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: It's not code related it's more of a engineering and design. That's why it's refractive hologram
05/07/2023, 9:12 pm - Saqib: Oops 😬

Like what kind of things involved in this.
05/07/2023, 9:13 pm - Saqib: A prism
05/07/2023, 9:13 pm - Saqib: 🤔
05/07/2023, 9:13 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: You have to design them in such a way that the optical light landing on the faces of the pyramid will intersect at the center. Meaning common focal point
05/07/2023, 9:13 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Yep
05/07/2023, 9:13 pm - Saqib: And it will generate the Picture there right?
05/07/2023, 9:13 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Yep
05/07/2023, 9:14 pm - Saqib: Is it on yt like how to build it
05/07/2023, 9:14 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Yeah, but for a small model like you can keep it on your phone
05/07/2023, 9:14 pm - Saqib: The prism then connects with voice and we can interact
05/07/2023, 9:14 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: I built a large one with my friends
05/07/2023, 9:14 pm - Saqib: Aah Nice.
05/07/2023, 9:15 pm - Saqib: Top G
05/07/2023, 9:15 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Yep
05/07/2023, 9:15 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: You can do that
05/07/2023, 9:15 pm - Saqib: I need to do experiments So I can make it
05/07/2023, 9:15 pm - Saqib: From where I should start
05/07/2023, 9:15 pm - Saqib: To make this
05/07/2023, 9:16 pm - Saqib: From scratch
05/07/2023, 9:16 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: First generate a design, then you remember the CD casset cases long back?
05/07/2023, 9:16 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: That are translucent and look like glass
05/07/2023, 9:16 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: You can use that too
05/07/2023, 9:17 pm - Saqib: How to design for   this
05/07/2023, 9:17 pm - Saqib: Yes yes
05/07/2023, 9:17 pm - Saqib: But now hardly any use
05/07/2023, 9:17 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Yeah, I made a one at home with that, it worked.
05/07/2023, 9:17 pm - Saqib: What things one needs to design it
05/07/2023, 9:18 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: But translucent glasses will work cause they refract more
05/07/2023, 9:18 pm - Saqib: Agree.
05/07/2023, 9:20 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Nothing much, a pen and a paper. Make sure the dimensions are to the point if you are going to look at a tutorial. If it's original optics is needed make the calculation learn the refractive index of the material you are using. Design one side, see where the images are projected by catching the refracted image on the other end with a piece of paper. And then make sure all the other sides of the prism are in the same dimensions
05/07/2023, 9:23 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: For the calculation you have make sure at what angle the sides are to calculate the incident and the refracted light. Position of the focal point on the other end.
05/07/2023, 9:23 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: If you are interested go ahead, it is interesting
05/07/2023, 9:24 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: It is fun
05/07/2023, 9:24 pm - Saqib: Yeah, Will look now
05/07/2023, 9:25 pm - Saqib: As I get free from other projects I will work on it
05/07/2023, 9:26 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Dude what do you do? Student or working
05/07/2023, 9:26 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: I was thinking how many projects you have
05/07/2023, 9:29 pm - Saqib: Both
05/07/2023, 9:29 pm - Saqib: Blockchain and Artificial intelligence
05/07/2023, 9:30 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: That's cool dude
05/07/2023, 9:30 pm - Saqib: Yeah. Was stuck with Microsoft project
05/07/2023, 9:30 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: What is your opinion on this one
05/07/2023, 9:31 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Based on the fMRI data
05/07/2023, 9:32 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: you any Brain Specialist,  Like You have a Great Knowledge 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣
05/07/2023, 9:34 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: See, Bro The Idea is Fantastic, But it also Needs a Great Knowledge , About Haardware that reads the Alpha and Theta Waves....!
🤷🏽‍♂️
05/07/2023, 9:39 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: <Media omitted>
05/07/2023, 9:39 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Well that's why it's called research brother. I feel we can figure it out as for the sensor
05/07/2023, 9:40 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: We need to figure out the range in each state of our mind. So I believe, we can use rasberry pi or even Arduino for visualizing the data
05/07/2023, 9:41 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: As for the algorithm, I have no idea as of now
05/07/2023, 9:42 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: But coding to one person can be done, by just defining our brain wave data into the code and setting conditional statements
05/07/2023, 9:42 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: This is what I had in mind
05/07/2023, 9:42 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: <Media omitted>
05/07/2023, 9:43 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: But the range there has to be some research
05/07/2023, 9:43 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: If we want to create an algo to calibrate based on any person
05/07/2023, 9:45 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: As for the ECM, I am aware of a throttle sensor from the ECM to the pedal. That's why cab companies precode the sensor conditions to less than 100 kph or 70kph to prevent cab drivers from speeding
05/07/2023, 9:46 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: We can connect the throttle sensor to the EEG
05/07/2023, 9:46 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: What do you think?
05/07/2023, 9:48 pm - Chirag Gaba🖤~: Its Not easy ...🤷🏽‍♂️
05/07/2023, 9:49 pm - Saqib: It is 👍
05/07/2023, 9:49 pm - Saqib: Good And Awesome 😎
05/07/2023, 9:49 pm - Saqib: Bro We need to Run the Startup
05/07/2023, 9:51 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: In terms of money, yes
05/07/2023, 9:51 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: But the process and path is pretty simple, the problem is you can never trust things in electronics or electrical engineering to go smoothly
05/07/2023, 9:51 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Sure
05/07/2023, 9:55 pm - Mohamed Farmaan: Lol, my head hurts. 😂
